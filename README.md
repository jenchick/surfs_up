## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
W. Avy, avid surfer and entrepreneur, wants to collaborate on opening up a surf shop/ice cream shop combo.  As was discovered in a previous analysis, Oahu appears to be a fantastic location for the surf/ice cream shop.  The precipitation is low, the weather is mild, and the waves are wonderful!  The final piece of analysis before diving in would be to examine the months of June and December more closely to determine whether or not the shop would be sustainable year-round.  

## Results: 
Weather Station data for the months of June and December over the past seven years was examined.  The charts below outline the findings from these weather stations.

- Key Differences Between the Two Months

  - More temperature observations are available for the month of June (11%).  However, it appears that there are enough observations in the month of December to find the data reliable.

  - December is only slightly cooler (by two to four degrees) than June when comparing the average, median, and maximum temparatures. 

  - However, the minimum temperature in December is eight degrees cooler, dipping into the mid fifties. 


## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Overall, based on the weather data, the surf/ice cream shop idea looks like a winner!  I would recommend looking more closely at the precipation data for these two months.  In addition to looking at weather to determine if a business is viable, I would strongly recommend a solid business plan.  

Having owned and operated an ice cream shop within a candy/toy store store in central texas for over five years, I think there are several other factors that need to be examined. I would recommend looking at locations, surrounding businesses, tourist and traffic flow, in addition to performing a gap analysis on ice cream shops and surf shops to determine if the area is over-saturated.  Also, what will be different about this shop when compared to the other shops in the area?  There appears to be some fierce competition, as evidenced by the following links:
